# Overview
Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics have enabled simultaneous preservation of high-throughput gene expression profiles and spatial context, enabling the high-resolution exploration of distinct regional characterization in brain tissue. However, the complex spatial structure of brain poses challenges in capturing spatial heterogeneity effectively and deciphering internal regulatory mechanisms accurately. Here, we develop stDCL, a dual graph contrastive learning method to identify spatial domains from spatial transcriptomics data. stDCL adaptively incorporates gene expression data and spatial information via a graph embedding autoencoder, thereby preserving critical information within latent embedding representations. Then, we propose dual graph contrastive learning to train the model, ensuring that the latent embedding representation closely resembles the actual spatial distribution and exhibits cluster similarity. Benchmarking stDCL against other state-of-the-art clustering methods using cerebral cortex datasets demonstrates its superior accuracy and effectiveness in identifying spatial domains. Our analysis of the imputation matrices generated by stDCL reveals its capability to reconstruct spatial hierarchical structures and refine differential expression assessments. Furthermore, we illustrate the central role of stDCL in elucidating gene regulation, spatial heterogeneity, and developmental patterns in the brain. Additionally, stDCL can also be instrumental in annotating disease-associated cellular phenotypes in Alzheimer's disease, unraveling the regulatory mechanisms.
